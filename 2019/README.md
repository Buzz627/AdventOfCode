Here are all the solutions I have comepleted so far for 2019.

Many of the puzzles this year have been using an [intcode](intCode.py) comuter to solve them. I have broken this out and used it as an object to be used in each day. Many of the puzzles require small changes to the intcode computer, but it should still work with each previous puzzle.
